# Deep Learning Library Testing via Effective Model Generation

This is the implementation repository of our ESEC/FSE 2020 paper:  **Deep Learning Library Testing via Effective Model Generation.** 

## Description

`LEMON` is a novel approach to testing DL libraries by generating effective DL models via guided mutation. The goal is to test DL libraries as sufficiently as possible by exploring unused library code or different usage ways of library code. We further propose a heuristic strategy in `LEMON` to guide the process of model generation so as to generate models that can amplify the inconsistent degrees for real bugs. In this way, it is clearer to distinguish real bugs and uncertain impacts in DL libraries. We conducted an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of `LEMON` based on `20` release versions of `TensorFlow`,`Theano,` `CNTK`, and `MXNet`. `LEMON` detected `24` new bugs in the latest release versions of these libraries. The results also demonstrate that the models generated by `LEMON` outperform existing models and the models generated without guidance in terms of the number of unique bugs/inconsistencies and the achieved inconsistent degrees. 

## Datasets/Models/Libraries

### Datasets/Models

We used `12` popular DL `models` based on `6` `datasets` including both images and sequential data, as the initial seed models in `LEMON`, which have been widely used in many existing studies.

1:  The first 5 models are trained using existing repositories while the last 7 models in ImageNet are obtained directly using the API provided by Keras.

2: We sampled 1500 images from ImageNet and you could obtain them from `sampled_imagenet-1500.npz`. You can also sample your own images from the [ImageNet validation dataset](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/nonpub-downloads). 

3: Keras applications tutorial can be found in: https://keras.io/api/applications/

4: All model files and two regression dataset and ImageNet dataset we sampled can be access in [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aj6dGBsJFcs0jnXVUfAtsEjdUW_T?e=ezo32C)

**NOTE**: LEMON use 6 dataset, and 3 of them could be directly obtained from their homepages  ( [CIFAR-10](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html),  [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) ) or accessed by [Keras API](https://keras.io/api/datasets/). We only upload the ImageNet dataset sampled by LEMON and two datasets collected from  GitHub.

In `dataset.zip`, there are 3 files:

> sinewave.csv: dataset of LSTM-1
> DIS.csv : dataset of LSTM-2
> sampled_imagenet-1500.npz:  dataset  samples by LEMON from  ImageNet 

In `origin_model.zip`, there are 12 models used in LEMON. 


### Libraries

We used `20` release versions of  `4` widely-used DL `libraries`, i.e., `TensorFlow`, `CNTK`,`Theano`, and `MXNet`, as subjects to constructed five experiments (indexed `E1` to `E5` in Table) to conduct differential testing.

We share the link of each library and docker image used in `LEMON`.

\* All libraries should be  `GPU-supported` version

## Reproducibility

### Environment 

We conducted 5 experiments in `LEMON` of which the library and CUDA version information are as described above. In order to facilitate other researchers to reproduce `LEMON`, we provide a `docker`  image for the `E1` experiment. It can be easily obtained by the following command. (**Note: nvidia-docker2 is required!**) 

**Step 0:** Please Install [nvidia-docker2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker). You can use this [instruction](https://codepyre.com/2019/01/installing-nvidia-docker2-on-ubuntu-18.0.4/) to install it.

**Step 1:** Clone the repository. Download the dataset and models from  [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aj6dGBsJFcs0jnXVUfAtsEjdUW_T?e=ezo32C). Save the code and unzip datasets and models to `/your/local/path/` , e.g. `/your/local/path/origin_model` and `/your/local/path/dataset`. (`/your/local/path/` should be the absolute path on your server, e.g. `/home/user_xxx/`)

**Step 2:** Using the following command to pull the docker image we released for `E1` and create a container for it. 

```shell
docker pull yenming1227/lemon:latest
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it -v /your/local/path/:/data  yenming1227/lemon:latest /bin/bash
```

Then you will enter a container.(Remember to change `/your/local/path/` to the real path! ^_^)

**Note: If your server is using http proxy, you should configure proxy in the container just as you did in your server before**

**Step 3:** Create five virtual environments as shown below in your docker container.

**Note: Please copy the installation command line by line to prevent some commands from being skipped.**

 ```shell
# tensorflow
conda create -n tensorflow python=3.6
source activate tensorflow
pip install -r lemon_requirements.txt
pip install keras==2.2.4
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0
source deactivate

# theano
conda create -n theano python=3.6
source activate theano
pip install -r lemon_requirements.txt
conda install pygpu=0.7.6
pip install keras==2.2.4
pip install theano==1.0.4
source deactivate

# cntk
conda create -n cntk python=3.6
source activate cntk
pip install -r lemon_requirements.txt
pip install keras==2.2.4
pip install cntk-gpu==2.7
source deactivate

# mxnet
conda create -n mxnet python=3.6
source activate mxnet
pip install -r lemon_requirements.txt
pip install keras-mxnet==2.2.4.2
pip install mxnet-cu101==1.5.1.post0
source deactivate

# default lemon python
conda create -n lemon python=3.6
source activate lemon
pip install -r lemon_requirements.txt
pip install keras==2.2.4
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0
source deactivate
 ```

### Redis Startup

LEMON uses redis to store intermediate outputs and exchange data between different processes. We have installed redis in our docker image, you can start it with the following command:

```bash
cd /root/redis-4.0.8/src
./redis-server ../redis.conf
```

### Running LEMON

The `LEMON` artifacts are well organized, and researchers can simply run `LEMON` with the following command. 

**Note: We conducted five large scale experiments (generating 100 mutants for each of the 12 initial models and analyzing inconsistencies on 1500 inputs and locating bugs) and you can reproduce the bugs reported in `LEMON` by running tool with `experiments.conf`. However, it could not be completed within `48`  hours. Therefore, we provide a `demo run`, which can be completed within `1` hour if you running the tool with `demo.conf`.**

```shell
cd /LEMON
git pull 
source activate lemon
```

We really  recommend you use `git pull` to update `LEMON` to the latest version.

**Mutation:**

```shell
python -u -m run.mutation_executor demo.conf
```

The above command shows how to generate mutants and calculating inconsistencies in `LEMON`. `demo.conf` is the configuration file we provided for `demo run`. 

**Localization:**

```shell
python -u -m run.localization_executor demo.conf
```

This command shows the way to perform localization in `LEMON`. The final  bug reports will be stored in path `/data/lemon_outputs/bug_list.txt` 

### Extension

`LEMON` also supports researchers to switch to other models and datasets. You only need to focus on the code snippets of the data processing part in `DataUtils.get_data_by_exp` in `scripts/tools/utils.py`.

```
# TODO: Add your own data preprocessing here
# Note: The returned inputs should be preprocessed and labels should decoded as one-hot vectors which could be directly feed in model. Both of them should be returned in batch, e.g. shape like (1500,28,28,1) and (1500,10)
# 
# elif 'xxx' in exp:
#     x_test, y_test = get_your_data(dataset_dir)
```

Besides, you should name your model file in format ` NetworkName-DatasetName_origin.h5`, e.g.  `mobilenet.1.00.224-imagenet_origin.h5`. 

Note: `_` and `-` can't be shown in `NetworkName`. You can replace them with `.` 

For example , changing  `mobilenet_1.00_224-imagenet_origin.h5` to `mobilenet.1.00.224-imagenet_origin.h5`.
